todo3r in qt
============

current features:
-----------------

 * Takes a list of files as command line input. If no files are present, then current directory is used.
 * all files specified are scanned for the appearance of "todo" (case insensitive) in any line. If a line is found, then it is spit out into stdout.
 * todo3r scans directories recursively.

features to be added in the future:
-----------------------------------

 * control recursive scanning of directories by a command line switch
 * specify files that are *not* to be scanned
 * find "todo" only in comments, not just anywhere
